				<h1>What is this site?</h1>
				<p>This website generates random YouTube videos by creating randomized 5 character strings,
					and searching YouTube for these strings. It adds these videos to a database where things like the title, and URL are stored.</p>

				<h1>Why?</h1>
				<p>I don't know man, it's just a slightly amusing way to pass time. This site is generally meant to be for personal use, and isn't
					really intended to be used by anyone other than myself and a few friends.</p>

				<h1>If it's intended to be private then why can I use it?</h1>
				<p>Because it hasn't become a problem yet, if a lot of people start using the site, and it becomes a problem,
				I will likely lock the website.</p>

				<h1>How can I create my own YouTube video generator?</h1>
				<p>The basis of how this website generates videos can be found on a StackOverflow post. It's just a couple of simple PHP functions and
				isn't hard to follow.
				<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11315416/how-do-i-get-a-random-youtube-video-with-the-youtube-api"><strong>Here</strong></a>
				is the page, it is the last post on the page and shows how to do it in multiple programming languages. This site does some other stuff
				too, but if you just want to create random videos, that would be where to start.</p>
